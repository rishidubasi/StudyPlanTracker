<h1>Study Plan Tracker</h1 </br>
This Python-based Study Plan Tracker helps you manage your study goals efficiently. By updating your daily study hours, it dynamically recalculates the remaining study hours and adjusts the daily study goal. The tool also visualizes your progress using a graph for a better understanding of your performance over time.

**Features**
Dynamic goal adjustment: Recalculates daily study targets based on your input.
Visual Progress: Displays a line chart showing the actual study hours and the required study hours for the remaining days.
Interactive Input: Collects daily study hours and updates the progress accordingly.
**How It Works**
Set your total study hours and days.
Enter your daily study hours.
The tool will display a graph and update the remaining study goal.
Repeat the process until your study plan is completed.
